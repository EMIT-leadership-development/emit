  <p>It is true that historically Africa is a patriarchal society, yet if you
  scratch the surface you will find that in reality, women are the lifeblood of
  African society. They are already the primary caregivers of their families and
  communities, the majority of workers in the church, and the vast majority of
  entrepreneurs in society (91%). And yet for these vital positions, few are
  preparing and motivating them.</p><p>Our Women for Women project allows you to
  invest in the lives of women in other parts of the world.</p>
