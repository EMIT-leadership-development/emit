# Reinforcing anti-fragility in Africa.

The past year was a rollercoaster ride. From new beginnings to new projects, mishaps to detours, uncertainty to surprising new ideas and success. It certainly was not dull.

EMIT adapted to new challenges and collaborated to maximize every opportunity. From our volunteers to the Board, everyone made EMIT better.

In his book Antifragile, Professor Nassim Taleb suggests “Anti-Fragility” as a replacement word for “strength.”

“Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Anti-fragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the anti-fragile gets better."

Anti-fragility goes beyond robustness; it means "something" may not just withstand shock but actually improve because of it.

Since 2020, EMIT has faced many challenges. With the help of the Lord, Board members, staff, and partners, EMIT has reinvented itself as a more robust, "anti-fragile" organization. The challenging, volatile circumstances did not break us. We learned lessons and developed systems that made us less vulnerable to randomness and chaos.

We opened an office in Texas dedicated to building partnerships and increasing capacity. In just 12 months, we already saw a 60% rise in income!&nbsp; All glory to God!

We were excited to begin the development of the “LINC” portal in 2022. When we launch LINC in 2023, we will be able to measure our outcomes and IMPACT.

As part of our commitment to the leaders of Africa, we want to finalize our Youth Curriculum in 2023. This will be a huge undertaking. The biggest challenge will be to generate the financial capacity to print the material and launch pilot projects for testing. Nothing is impossible for our God!

We will continue to build our anti-fragility during 2023. We will remind ourselves that with God, we can do anything. Please pray for EMIT as we continue to execute our calling obediently.
