			By definition, synergy is a state in witch two or more things work together in a particularly fruitful way to produce an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects.<br /><br />The value of synergy is the reason why Kingdom partnerships have been the foundational building blocks of EMIT from its very inception. We value your partnership!
