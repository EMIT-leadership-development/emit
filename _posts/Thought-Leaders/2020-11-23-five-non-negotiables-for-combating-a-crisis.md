**Faith**

The importance of faith is always highlighted during a period of crisis.&nbsp; When facing major setbacks or life-threatening situations, faith becomes the foundation on which we build our hope.&nbsp; The Bible is filled with examples, lessons, and encouragement concerning faith.&nbsp;

Faith isn’t the absence of fear, faith is what overcomes fear.&nbsp; We need to continue to actively trust in Jesus and refuse to let circumstances determine our faith in Him.&nbsp; Although we cannot see the complete picture while we are in a crisis, faith is the substance that changes uncertainty into reality.&nbsp; Faith in God permits Him to intervene in our circumstances.&nbsp; Just as Peter looked at the waves and winds of adversity and called upon Jesus for help, so we must put our complete faith in Him.&nbsp; Whatever impossible situations you and I have to face, our faith in Jesus will overcome all of those circumstances. &nbsp;

**Calling and vision**

During a time of crisis, it is easy to forget that God has called us for a purpose.&nbsp; Although the whole world came crashing down during the COVID-19 pandemic and in an instant, we had to face a new reality, God’s calling and plan for our lives did not change.&nbsp; As an organization, our clarity of calling and vision was one of the strongest motivations and reasons for our positive reaction to the challenges of COVID-19.&nbsp;

**Creativity**

People react differently to crisis.&nbsp; The enemy many times robs us of our ability to react positively and creatively to a crisis.&nbsp; Our ability to create is part of our Godly DNA.&nbsp; We should engage every crisis with a proactive positive attitude to create solutions for the problems.&nbsp; We must open our minds to new paradigms and fight the urge to resist change.&nbsp; Creativity always happens at the fringes.&nbsp; COVID-19 forced us to re-evaluate and re-think our past reality, and re-imagine a new and better future. &nbsp;

**Strong leadership**

The burden that COVID-19 placed on leadership was exponential.&nbsp; Many leaders were overcome by fear.&nbsp; The uncertainty of the future overwhelmed leaders in all spheres of society.&nbsp; Organizations and institutions that had strong leadership not only managed to cope with the crisis but to excel during the crisis.&nbsp; These leaders took personal responsibility to lead their organizations through the crisis.&nbsp; They did not allow the circumstances or their own uncertainties to dictate their decision making and the future of their organizations. They reacted early, took calculated risks, and led strongly from the front.&nbsp; They instilled trust by communicating frequently and showing empathy. &nbsp;Strong leaders understood that they even had to change their own leadership styles and do more than what was expected from them, to create prosperity.&nbsp;

**See crisis as an opportunity**

In every crisis, there is an opportunity to engage, innovate, and connect.&nbsp; The drastic changes of the last 9 months also brought with it great opportunities.&nbsp; Those that saw the opportunities now testify that they are emerging stronger, more creative, and making a bigger impact than before.&nbsp; Individuals and organizations that had managed to turn challenges into opportunities now testify that they do not want to go back to a previous normal.&nbsp; Looking back in history illustrates that crisis and extreme threads can be useful to guide us into new and beneficial possibilities.&nbsp; Leaders that used the crisis as an opportunity, managed to guide their institutions to a more effective and impactful future.&nbsp; The challenge is to continue to dream and to keep our eyes on the big picture.
