# The Greatest Strength of Leadership is Integrity.

Integrity is defined as the quality of being honest and having unshakable moral principles and strong values. Integrity suggests always doing the right thing, even when no one is looking.

One would think that people who serve in leadership roles would automatically have high levels of integrity. Not true! The reality is that integrity is, in many cases, a lost characteristic. Many want to be known as leaders, but not all have this secret strength.

From major corporations to small businesses, first-world governments to third-world dictators, established political parties to ground-level political leaders, mega churches to small groups of believers under a tree, all have been hit with the disappointment of some leaders’ lack of integrity.

Why is it important?

When leaders fail, the impact reaches far beyond the leader and his immediate community. The lack of leadership integrity has increased animosity toward those in leadership positions.

&nbsp;"Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it." - Proverbs 4:23 NIV

Scripture uses the heart as a metaphor for the inner man. We should guard our hearts because it’s there that decisions are made that will impact our lives and those of others. Integrity flows from a pure heart.

* Integrity builds trust and credibility.

Leaders who demonstrate integrity accumulate trust among their colleagues and constituents. They stand up and defend what they believe in. They do not back down and change their narrative when confronted. Truth is their compass, and they will fight to protect it, even to thein detriment.&nbsp;

* Integrity inspires others.

Those that lead with integrity will inspire others to follow their example. Leaders must model and actively reinforce integrity for everyone to create a culture that values integrity.

* Integrity drives out fear and leads to success.

Part of practicing integrity is being unafraid of inconvenient or uncomfortable truths. It allows you to make decisions based on firm ethical and moral beliefs and not compromise to suit the masses.

* It is time to rise and let integrity do the talking and the walking.

To lead with integrity is an intentional choice. Choose to focus on character and the embracing of Biblical and Kingdom principles. Let your life be a testimony of integrity. Commit yourself to a lifestyle that demonstrates high levels of integrity, the hidden strength of leadership.
