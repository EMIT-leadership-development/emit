# It’s Working\!

## EMIT leaders are transforming their communities.

Meet Mervis Malambo. Mervis initially trained for Youth Ministry with Teen Missions. &nbsp;She worked with them for a couple of years in Zambia and the USA. After returning to Africa, she started working with Rock of Hope ministries in a town called Kabwe in Zambia. It is here where she was introduced to the training of EMIT. &nbsp;She enrolled to the Pastoral Leadership Program and graduated 4 years later. Mervis later completed her Bachelor's in Theology. &nbsp;

Mervis' passion for her community was evident right from the start. &nbsp;She also understood the principle of inﬂuence and the role that leaders could play in the transforming of their communities. &nbsp;In 2017 she was selected to become a project leader for the two Pastoral and one Women Leadership Program. &nbsp;

The need of the younger generation spoke to Mervis early on in her ministry. &nbsp;She became a strong advocate for issues pertaining the youth. &nbsp;The importance of well-trained youth leaders is one of her passions. &nbsp;She believes that young people are the leaders of today rather than tomorrow.&nbsp;

Mervis played a huge role in implementing the small group model in the three programs that she oversees in Zambia. &nbsp;She realized the potential of the small group model, and immediately started inﬂuencing the leaders in the small groups to be more involved in their communities. &nbsp;She became the biggest cheerleader for community involvement and transformation in Zambia. &nbsp;Her teams made a huge diﬀerence during COVID by serving in diﬀerent projects. &nbsp;

Students were mobilized to embarked on a program to help the needy. They received training on creative thinking and implementing change. &nbsp;This led to multiple initiatives that impacted communities positively all over the country. &nbsp;

In one of these projects, Mervis encouraged students to reach out to parents whose children were admitted to hospital. &nbsp;These parents would stay on the hospital grounds in temporary shelters until their kids are released. &nbsp;Many of these parents would not have any food or other basic needs. &nbsp;The teams took responsibility for these parents by preparing meals and serving them with love and dignity. &nbsp;

Mervis says: “We have learnt so much from EMIT. A huge investment was made into our training and development. It is time for us to give back. &nbsp;We want to be a blessing in our community. We want to be part of community transformation. &nbsp;As leaders we want to make a diﬀerence, even if this means sharing the little, we have in our own homes. &nbsp;We will continue to do so as long as the need exists. I am amazed to see the big diﬀerence that was made by our humble gifts and service. &nbsp;God is faithful.”

It is testimonies like this that EMIT lives for. We get energized by the transformation that is brought on by the leaders we equip.
