## EMIT Report 2021 - French Speaking Countries

The prosperity and wellbeing of Francophone Countries in Africa are continuously under threat by political unrest, disease, corruption, and severe poverty. These countries are some of the richest in natural resources, yet they are also some of the poorest on the continent. Despite all these challenges, there are many encouraging signs of progress.

After the genocide in Rwanda, trust became one of the major obstacles in getting church leaders together for training. &nbsp;Gradually it became clear to the leaders that EMIT was there to serve them and their communities. EMIT responsibly addressed their concerns and fears and challenged the leaders to forgive each other.&nbsp;<br>These leaders became instrumental in bringing about reconciliation, healing, and peace in their nation. The mistrust eventually subsided and over the last 20 years we trained more than 2120 church leaders face to face in Rwanda and more than 21000 church leaders were trained in our On-10 program.

The thousands of Rwandan and Congolese leaders we have since trained, continue to uplift, transform, and invest in their communities - a testimony that radiates throughout Francophone Africa. EMIT reconciles leaders and communities\!

Our training in the eastern part of DR Congo was threatened in 2019 by another Ebola outbreak. Amid the turmoil of the outbreak, our local committees served church leaders in hotspot cities such as Beni, Bunia, and Butembo. Rebel groups also constantly threatens to kill civilians. It has been inspiring to see the levels of commitment that our volunteers exhibited during this diﬃcult time.&nbsp;

COVID-19 added to an already desperate situation. &nbsp;Our committed team members in the French-speaking countries responded positively to the situation.&nbsp;

Our teams implemented the new model of training in small groups of 10 to 15 people with great success. 54 Facilitators were trained in small group learning principles. We were able to train 369 face to face students with 3380 On-10 trainees.

Our leaders eﬀectively started new supporting programs to communities in need. These programs are improving the lives of thousands of impoverished and suﬀering communities.&nbsp;

With high spirit and resilience, we will move forward and achieve our goals to the glory of God.&nbsp;
