I"ø<p>It is not disputable that Africa is the poorest continent in the world, and the richest in terms of natural resources. Today the image of this blessed continent is battered by corruption, nepotism and a leadership crisis. Corruption has tragically devastated African societies and made millions of people destitute. The tentacles of corruption have reached everywhere on the African continent. We find corruption in the offices of presidents and prime ministers to the smallest administration unit of government. Businesses, and even the church, are not excluded. Crucial to this crisis of corruption engulfing the African continent is the problem of purposeful leadership that could act as architect and engineer of progressive change and development.</p>
