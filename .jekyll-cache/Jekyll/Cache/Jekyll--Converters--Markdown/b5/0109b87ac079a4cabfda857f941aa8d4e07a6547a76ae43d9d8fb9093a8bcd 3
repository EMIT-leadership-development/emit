<p>The name AFMIN served us well these past years while we were only focused on Pastoral Leadership training in Africa. However, pilot projects in other parts of the world, e.g. Europe, proved the name problematic as ‚ÄúAFMIN ‚Äì Africa Ministries Network‚Äù is so strongly associated with training only in Africa.</p>
