I"<p>It is true that historically Africa is a patriarchal society, yet if you scratch the surface you will find that in reality, women are the lifeblood of African society. They are already the primary caregivers of their families and communities, the majority of workers in the church, and the vast majority of entrepreneurs in society (91%). And yet for these vital positions, few are preparing and motivating them.</p>
<p>Our Women for Women project allows you to invest in the lives of women in other parts of the world.</p>
