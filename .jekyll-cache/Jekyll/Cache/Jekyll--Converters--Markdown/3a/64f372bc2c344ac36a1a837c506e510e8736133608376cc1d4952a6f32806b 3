<p>When asked to imagine a learning environment, most of us will picture a classroom with students and a teacher.  We likely picture a lecturer, standing in front of the classroom, droning on and on, with students listening passively, if not asleep.  Most of us will recognize this picture from our own education experiences. The truth is that adults learn much differently than children.  In adult education, we need to move away from this traditional teacher-centered approach towards a role as facilitator of adult learning. The good news is facilitation is a skill that can be improved!</p>
