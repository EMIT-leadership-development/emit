<p>The genocide that occurred in Rwanda during the ‚Äú100 days of slaughter‚Äù in 1994 plunged a nation and its people into unimaginable affliction. Hatred, distrust, pain, civil discord, tribal war and the like were a daily reminder of the horrific events that devastated that country.</p>

<h4 id="today-these-leaders-work-hand--in-hand">Today these leaders work hand- in-hand</h4>
<p>We are humbled by the multitude of testimonies about the instrumental role EMIT played during the past 20 years, transforming the cultural landscape of Rwanda. At first, we brought leaders together filled with hatred, fear, and trauma. Today these leaders work hand- in-hand to further national peace and ensure a better future for generations to come. From a grassroots level to government, EMIT leaders strive to bring transformation to communities, cities and the nation.</p>

<h4 id="dr-bunini-offers-care-and-mentoring-to-children">Dr. Bunini offers care and mentoring to children</h4>
<p>One such leader is Dr. Bunini Gahungu Protais. He is involved in numerous community transformation projects, including a program that offers care to street-children and trains them to become contributing members of society. He has also founded a project that fights drug abuse amongst the youth and does extensive work in the prevention of HIV/Aids.</p>
