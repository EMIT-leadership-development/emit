<p>The name AFMIN served us well these past years while we were only focused on Pastoral Leadership training in Africa. However, pilot projects in other parts of the world, e.g. Europe, proved the name problematic as ‚ÄúAFMIN ‚Äì Africa Ministries Network‚Äù is so strongly associated with training only in Africa. <!--more--> The ‚ÄúMinistry‚Äù part in Africa Ministries Network, also make us sound like we are a church, which we are not, and consequently it is hard for professional organizations, like Universities to partner with us. We are a non-profit, Leadership Development organization.</p>

<p>While nothing has changed about our primary vision, namely, Training Leaders, Transforming Nations, the new name, EMIT, is professional and strengthens us in expanding our Leadership Development vision to all segments of society and eventually, other continents too.</p>
