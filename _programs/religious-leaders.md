description_markdown: >-
  Religious Leaders are widespread throughout Africa and have great influence in
  their communities. Yet, they lack proper training and vision to effectively
  transform those communities. This program gives leaders the theoretical
  framework, but also the practical knowledge and skills to rise above their
  circumstances and bring systematic change to the communities they serve. This
  program is designed to address 3 main areas needed for transformation –
  personal and character development, leadership development and professional
  skills development.
