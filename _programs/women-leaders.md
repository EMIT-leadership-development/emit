description_markdown: >-
  Women are placed in leadership and executive level positions at an increasing
  rate. Yet, in Africa, most educational and development programs are focused on
  men. Women are many times encouraged to rather pursue more traditional roles.
  This program is focused entirely on women and their development. It gives
  these leaders the theoretical framework, but also the practical knowledge and
  skills to rise above their circumstances and bring systematic change to the
  communities they serve. The program is designed to address 3 main areas needed
  for transformation – personal and character development, leadership
  development and professional skills development.
