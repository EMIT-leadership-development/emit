description_markdown: >-
  Africa boasts the largest youth population globally, with a staggering 60% of
  its inhabitants under the age of 25. Regrettably, past generations have set a
  poor precedent, leading the youth to develop a distorted view of what true
  leadership entails. Presently, many young individuals associate leadership
  with abuse of power, bribery, and corruption.


  Our program seeks to challenge and correct this negative perception of
  leadership. Through offering a compelling and inspiring portrayal of effective
  leadership, we aim to instill in students a set of values that they can adopt
  and integrate into their own lives.


  This program is designed for senior high school students who have been
  selected as leaders (prefects) and aims to fill the gap in youth leadership
  training. The training focuses on essential soft skills that are crucial for
  Gen-Z leaders, while also enhancing other skills necessary for their future
  success.


  The curriculum consists of 30 one-hour sessions that empower these leaders to
  apply fundamental leadership knowledge, skills, and abilities. The training
  utilizes small group facilitation, which is both straightforward and highly
  impactful. Small groups foster open communication in an empowering setting,
  allowing values to be explored rather than simply taught. This approach
  encourages active participation and collaboration among the leaders, enhancing
  their overall learning experience.
