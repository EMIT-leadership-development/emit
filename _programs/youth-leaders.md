motivation: >-
  Presently the vast majority of Africa’s population is younger than 25 years
  old. We aim to equip youth leaders while they are in school, enabling them to
  develop their leadership skills as they mature. This will ensure a next
  generation of effective leaders.
status: developing
entrance: Applicants must be recognized as leaders in their respective schools and preferably serve on the student leadership.
delivery: Courses will be presented face-to-face through a facilitation process in a small group format.
duration: This course is still in the development phase. Therefore, the number of subjects and duration are not yet finalized.
assessment: Assessment of learning is incorporated within the course material and therefore is done regularly and throughout the program.
certification: The curriculum wil be designed to address wholistic leadership development to ensure community impact and transformation. It is therefore not an academic qualification. A “Certificate of Completion” is issued at the completion of the program.
graduation: Students graduate after they have attended all classes, trained 10 other leaders and paid their tuition in full. Graduations take place at each local venue.
