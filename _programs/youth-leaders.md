objective_markdown:
motivation: >-
  Presently the vast majority of Africa’s population is younger than 25 years
  old. We aim to equip youth leaders while they are in school, enabling them to
  develop their leadership skills as they mature. This will ensure a next
  generation of effective leaders.
status: developing
entrance: >-
  Applicants must be recognized as leaders in their respective schools and
  preferably serve on the student leadership.
delivery: >-
  Courses will be presented face-to-face through a facilitation process in a
  small group format.
duration: >-
  This course is still in the development phase. Therefore, the number of
  subjects and duration are not yet finalized.
assessment: >-
  Assessment of learning is incorporated within the course material and
  therefore is done regularly and throughout the program.
certification: >-
  The curriculum wil be designed to address wholistic leadership development to
  ensure community impact and transformation. It is therefore not an academic
  qualification. A “Certificate of Completion” is issued at the completion of
  the program.
graduation: >-
  Students graduate after they have attended all classes, trained 10 other
  leaders and paid their tuition in full. Graduations take place at each local
  venue.
description_markdown: >-
  Youth Leaders are identified from a very early age. They are expected to set
  an example to their friends and play an important role in the development of
  society. Yet, they are never equipped to deal with the power, pressures and
  responsibilities this brings. This program gives youth leaders the theoretical
  framework, but also the practical knowledge and skills to equip them to deal
  with these issues and bring systematic change to the communities they live in.
  The program is designed to address 3 main areas needed for transformation –
  personal and character development, leadership development and professional
  skills development. &nbsp;
