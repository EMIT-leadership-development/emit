motivation: >-
  Presently the vast majority of Africa’s population is younger than 25 years
  old. We aim to equip youth leaders while they are in school, enabling them to
  develop their leadership skills as they mature. This will ensure a next
  generation of effective leaders.
status: developing
entrance: >-
  Applicants must be recognized as leaders in their respective schools and
  preferably serve on the student leadership.
delivery: >-
  Courses will be presented face-to-face through a facilitation process in a
  small group format.
duration: >-
  This course is still in the development phase. Therefore, the number of
  subjects and duration are not yet finalized.
assessment: >-
  Assessment of learning is incorporated within the course material and
  therefore is done regularly and throughout the program.
certification: >-
  The curriculum wil be designed to address wholistic leadership development to
  ensure community impact and transformation. It is therefore not an academic
  qualification. A “Certificate of Completion” is issued at the completion of
  the program.
graduation: >-
  Students graduate after they have attended all classes, trained 10 other
  leaders and paid their tuition in full. Graduations take place at each local
  venue.
description_markdown: >-
  Africa has the largest youth population in the world with 60% of its
  population under 25. Unfortunately, decades of poor examples have given youth
  a skewed picture of what leadership is supposed to be. Due to the prevailing
  mindset among today's youth, leadership is often associated with misuse of
  authority, bribery, and corruption. This program aims to rectify this negative
  perception of leadership. By presenting a compelling and inspiring depiction
  of leadership, we provide students with a set of values that they can readily
  embrace and incorporate into their own lives.


  This program is developed specifically for final-year high school learners who
  were chosen as leaders (prefects) and addresses the lack of youth leadership
  training. This training highlights the much-needed soft skills that Gen-Z
  leaders need and strengthens other skills that will prepare them for their
  future. The curriculum includes 30 one-hour topics that empower these leaders
  to apply foundational leadership knowledge, skills, and abilities. Small group
  facilitation is used in this training, which is both simple and highly
  effective. Small groups facilitate two-way communication within an empowering
  environment. Instead of being taught, values are explored.
