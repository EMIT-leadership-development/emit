We believe that equipping Africa’s leadership is the most eﬀective way to achieve the lasting regeneration that has been elusive for generations.</h2>

<p>“Everything rises and falls on leadership,” says Dr. John C. Maxwell, global leadership expert. Africa has incredible wealth! Natural resources abound and the people have a resilient spirit. Couple that with a never-say-die attitude and one would expect continued success and prosperity. Yet, with all this potential and decades of ﬁnancial aid, the continent is still rife with corruption, nepotism, civil wars, adverse poverty, poorly educated youth, failing governments, and more.</p>

<p>All of these factors converge to make Africa unappealing to international investors. The World Economic Forum reports there is an ongoing discussion on the eﬀectiveness of foreign aid in helping the economic development of Africa. One thing is clear: the outcomes are not what Africa’s development partners had hoped for, and the reasons are not implausible. </p>

<p>Many African countries are said to be like planes piloted by people who have never attended a ﬂight school. Everyone blames the pilot when the plane crashes. As a result, the question is: where are Africa’s “ﬂying schools” for leadership? How and where do Africans learn the advanced leadership skills needed to lead the continent into development?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reality is that the continent’s elite class tends to appropriate existing curriculum for leadership development in costly executive education programs in business schools, whose fees are out of reach for the vast majority of the population.</p>

<p>Adding to this dilemma is the fact that “knowing how to lead is only half the battle. Understanding leadership and actually leading are two diﬀerent activities”, as Dr. Maxwell explains. He says the key to transforming yourself from someone who understands leadership to a person who successfully leads in the real world is character. Your character qualities activate and empower your leadership ability, or they can stand in the way of your success!</p>

<p>Africa needs change agents that will leverage both business and non-proﬁt platforms to oﬀer leadership development training to a large proportion of the population. This is where EMIT has a vital role to play in the development of leaders in Africa. We deliver training through a network of leaders reaching into the remotest areas of the continent. Our training delivers skills and knowledge through mentoring relationships by a life-changing process over a number of years. </p>

<p>We produce equipped leaders who improve well-being within their sphere of impact. They are mentors that multiply themselves by imparting skills and life-changing values. They look for opportunities to serve and lead within their community. Leadership that will impact and transform Africa is not limited to high-ranking oﬃcials but includes everyone willing to take up their cross of leadership and serve. </p>

<p>Opportunities to lead and serve are everywhere. We only need to open our eyes.</p>

<p>This is our passion. This is what we strive for. And with hard work, we will see a transformed Africa! </p>
