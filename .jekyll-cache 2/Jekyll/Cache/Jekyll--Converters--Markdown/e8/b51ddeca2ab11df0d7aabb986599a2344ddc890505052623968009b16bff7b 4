<p>Meet Mervis Malambo. Mervis initially trained for Youth Ministry with Teen Missions. Â She worked with them for a couple of years in Zambia and the USA. After returning to Africa, she started working with Rock of Hope ministries in a town called Kabwe in Zambia. It is here where she was introduced to the training of EMIT. Â She enrolled to the Pastoral Leadership Program and graduated 4 years later. Mervis later completed her Bachelorâ€™s in Theology. Â </p>

<p>Mervisâ€™ passion for her community was evident right from the start. Â She also understood the principle of inï¬‚uence and the role that leaders could play in the transforming of their communities. Â In 2017 she was selected to become a project leader for the two Pastoral and one Women Leadership Program. Â </p>

<p>The need of the younger generation spoke to Mervis early on in her ministry. Â She became a strong advocate for issues pertaining the youth. Â The importance of well-trained youth leaders is one of her passions. Â She believes that young people are the leaders of today rather than tomorrow.Â </p>

<p>Mervis played a huge role in implementing the small group model in the three programs that she oversees in Zambia. Â She realized the potential of the small group model, and immediately started inï¬‚uencing the leaders in the small groups to be more involved in their communities. Â She became the biggest cheerleader for community involvement and transformation in Zambia. Â Her teams made a huge diï¬€erence during COVID by serving in diï¬€erent projects. Â </p>

<p>Students were mobilized to embarked on a program to help the needy. They received training on creative thinking and implementing change. Â This led to multiple initiatives that impacted communities positively all over the country. Â </p>

<p>In one of these projects, Mervis encouraged students to reach out to parents whose children were admitted to hospital. Â These parents would stay on the hospital grounds in temporary shelters until their kids are released. Â Many of these parents would not have any food or other basic needs. Â The teams took responsibility for these parents by preparing meals and serving them with love and dignity. Â </p>

<p>Mervis says: â€œWe have learnt so much from EMIT. A huge investment was made into our training and development. It is time for us to give back. Â We want to be a blessing in our community. We want to be part of community transformation. Â As leaders we want to make a diï¬€erence, even if this means sharing the little, we have in our own homes. Â We will continue to do so as long as the need exists. I am amazed to see the big diï¬€erence that was made by our humble gifts and service. Â God is faithful.â€</p>

<p>It is testimonies like this that EMIT lives for. We get energized by the transformation that is brought on by the leaders we equip.</p>
