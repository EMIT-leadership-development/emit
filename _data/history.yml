    <ul><li>COVID-19 has dramatically changed the world we find ourselves
    in.&nbsp; Business and consumer behaviours have changed significantly. New
    paradigms have been introduced to all spheres of daily life. &nbsp; Many of
    these behaviours will remain long after the defeat of the
    virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The leadership of EMIT adopted a proactive
    approach early in the crisis. This helped us to become very creative in
    developing a different model of training that suited our new reality. By
    June of 2020 we started training our more than 370 volunteers in Africa, as
    facilitators. These facilitators now gather EMIT students in their areas in
    small groups of not more than 15 for training.&nbsp; Our manuals have been
    re-formatted to suite small group training events.&nbsp;</p><p>EMIT will
    continue to study the behavioural shifts in our industry. We will adjust and
    modify our products and services. We are ready to act quickly to meet
    current and future student needs. The executive team, full time staff and
    volunteers are committed to continue to develop relevant training materials
    and to keep on serving our students with passion and
    excellence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/the-next-steps.html">Link to Full
