Together, from 1985-2006, Ted and Gayle grew New Life Church from a small group of people meeting in their home to a 14,000-member congregation. During that time, Gayle directed women's ministries, teaching women of all ages and overseeing 150 women's small groups. In recent years, Gayle and Ted have walked through many of life's challenges and emerged with their faith, marriage, and family stronger than ever because of what they experienced and learned. Gayle is the author of the New York Times best-selling book, Why I Stayed: the Choices I Made in my Darkest Hour, and her newest book, Courageous Grace. Today, Gayle enjoys sharing the hope, love, and grace that strengthened her during the most difficult seasons of her life. Gayle and Ted currently pastor St. James Church in Colorado Springs where Gayle continues to lead a ministry to women. She and Ted have five children and five grandchildren</p>
