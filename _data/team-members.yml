    <p>Kobus has been involved in the training and equipping of leaders since
    1991. He firmly believes that the lack of trained leaders is to blame for
    many of the problems experienced in Africa and the rest of the world.
    Transformational Leadership will result in changed communities and
    ultimately Nations. He is pragmatic in his approach to the problems of
    Africa and leads many community projects in his city as part of his own
    contribution to address the needs of those that cannot help themselves. He
