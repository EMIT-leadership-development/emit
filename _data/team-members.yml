    many of the problems experienced in Africa and the rest of the world.
    Transformational Leadership will result in changed communities and
    ultimately Nations. He is pragmatic in his approach to the problems of
    Africa and leads many community projects in his city as part of his own

    <p>Keith Toogood is a 2005 &amp; 2006 graduate of the Texas Tech University
    Rawls College of Business where he obtained three bachelors of business
    degrees: Marketing, Management, &amp; General Business. During his time at
    Texas Tech, Keith was also awarded four letters as a placekicker for the Red
    Raiders. Upon finishing his collegiate career, Keith had some workouts with
    N.F.L. teams, but he ultimately made the decision to pursue a career in
    business.</p><p>From 2007-2014 Keith worked at Endeavour Enterprises, a west
    Texas restaurant group that operates Pizza Huts, and west Texas staple, Taco
    Villa. During his time there, he rose in the ranks starting his career as an
    assistant manager and finishing his career as an area manager overseeing
    eight locations.</p><p>In 2014, after inadvertently flipping several houses
    that he and his wife, Brandi, lived in, they started Toogood Built which has
    exploded into Kingdom building residential and commercial construction
    business located in Lubbock, Texas. Then, in 2019, Keith added another
    business to his arsenal when God opened the doors to become a franchisee of
    Orangetheory Fitness located in San Angelo, Texas.</p><p>Beyond his love for
    business, Keith has always had a burning passion for the kingdom of God. On
    July 27th, 2019 that fire sparked into a raging wild fire when God met him
    on a bus headed to Glorieta, New Mexico for kids camp. While sitting on that
    bus, God gave Keith a bold mission: wake up a generation of business leaders
    and stoke the fire in the next generation of young men &mdash; all for His
    kingdom advancement. At that very moment, BOOM (Business Operating On
    Mission &amp; Bros Operating On Mission) was born. Since that day, God has
    been connecting Keith across the globe as He works through the hearts of men
    to realize their true identity and calling in God&rsquo;s kingdom. In March
    of 2021, Keith followed through on the Lord&rsquo;s prompting and launched
    the Six Eight Summit alongside BOOM C.O.O., Roswell Smith Jr., with a
    mission to rebuild the kingdom of God through the hearts of men and
    business.</p><p>Keith has been married to his incredible wife, Brandi, for
    15 years. Together, they have three beautiful children. Graham, Harper, and
    Beckett.</p>
