    <p>I have successfully launched and led impactful organizations spanning
    multiple industries most of my life.Skill in developing high-performing
    teams that create and capture value lies at the core.My focus has now
    shifted to help others do the same.</p><p>Every person wants to flourish in
    business and life. I help leaders get both done without compromising
    either.Perhaps the most challenging business I helped build recently is
    Jibu. Over the last few years Jibu has launched hundreds of new business
    owners and thousands of outlets across seven African countries to sell (not
    give away) drinking water and other life necessities. Jibu makes lasting
    impact a reality every day, not just in customers&rsquo; health but in
    providing a business opportunity that transforms the lives of its
    entrepreneurs.</p><p>Powerful, rewarding- and crazy travel to Africa for
    eight years, gobbling up about six months every year- helped sharpen my
    focus to make every moment count.</p><p>My passion for efficiency and
    productivity is surely rooted in some near-death close calls when young,
    including a broken neck, a near-bear attack, and more. I learned the hard
    way how to prioritize what really matters. We can make more money but none
    of us more time.Over the years I have become well-practiced at producing at
    a higher level while enjoying a nice quality of life. It's not either/or.
    Many leaders assume, 'when this project is done I will then have the time to
    figure out how to prioritize better". But that time never seems to come.
    Perhaps I could help in this area.It&rsquo;s pretty natural for me to see
    potential where others may not- in opportunities and people.I am a genuine
    encourager with a track record of helping others find courage to dream
    bigger and succeed more than they thought possible.I get energy out of
    tackling complex challenges rife with grayness, unknowns, and
    tradeoffs.</p><p>To succeed, I know how critical it is to work in the
    context of a high-performing team. I am currently pulling together
    growth-oriented CEOs in Colorado to form a peer advisory board that will
    have far-reaching effects on our businesses, families, and communities.We
    work on complex issues and help each other grow by examining opportunities
    and shore up blind spots collaboratively. I also provide one-on-one coaching
    to help leaders maximize their potential, resources, and time. I&rsquo;ve
    found Vistage to be a great partner with a long track record of success to
    help me do this.</p>
