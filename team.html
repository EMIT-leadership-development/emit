        	A great team is a powerful concept that you can put to work in nearly any industry. Strategically building a team for important projects is an efficient way to tackle any organization's challenges. Of course, a great team doesn't just benefit the organization; it can also boost morale and camaraderie, increase job satisfaction and help employees stretch their abilities and raise their profile. Working in teams provides people more opportunities to release their creative ideas and increases their sense of belonging.
